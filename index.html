              <h2>Introduction</h2>
              <p>I graduated from Texas Tech University in 2006 with a Bachelor's Degree in Political Science and Communication Studies.  After graduation, I attended South Texas College of Law and received my Doctorate of Jurisprudence in 2009 and passed the Texas Bar Exam in July of 2009.  For the two (2) years following admittance to the Bar, I was a criminal defense lawyer.  I also was an adjunct professor for five (5) years at my former law school teaching a class titled, "Actual Innocence Clinic."  Since then, I have worked as the Vice President for my father's company, Rome Refreshment Services.  We have provided vending, water filtration, coffee, and micro-market services to the Greater Houston Area since 1979.  </p>

            <article id="about-me">
              <h2>About Me</h2>
              <p>Ever since I was a kid, I have loved technology and computers.  I remember in the mid-90's our family getting our first computer, a 486.  I spent as much time on that thing as I possibly could.  When the internet finally became more widely available, I started making very basic web pages on Geocities, Angel Fire, and Tripod.  Since then I have made some web pages for my previous law firm and current company utilizing WordPress.</p>
              <p>I have worked well with others in my current position.  I manage 7 route drivers with daily tasks and routes while also working in concert with my technicians and the owner.  One person can't do everything themselves so dividing a project so that each individual specializes in a few aspects of that project will be best for the organization as a whole, which is what we are all after.</p>
              <p> I welcome the potential to work with others in a collaborative way.  I will strive to be an equal member of the team and receive criticism while offering help wherever possible.  I am not only willing to work with others, but I also welcome it.</p>
              <p>Some things I like outside of web development are:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Reading</li>
                <li>Podcasts</li>
                <li>Trying New Food</li>
              </ul>
